- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MrWei95
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in microcontrollers, user interaction , electronic equipments and video games(maybe last one has little to do with GitHubğŸ˜‚).
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Loongson 99PAI for months, during the process, I realized that I knew too little about Linux, but fortunately this situation is now changing.
- ğŸ“– Some of my learning materials are stored in my blog page. You can check it out If you are interested. Just [Click Here](https://mrwei95.github.io/).
